Creating a real world functional app with express

Mini LMS Inventory System:

Tables:

1. Courses
2. Teachers
3. Students

Relationships:

1. A course belongs to one or more instructors
2. A student can take multiple courses
3. Courses have different cats

(Ever since my TODO project - to workit-kit, categories = cats)
