Creating a real world functional app with express

Mini LMS Inventory System

The table schema has since been changed from what it was to what it is now, it does have a few mistakes - however, it is to serve as a foundation to drill into me working with express and pg. The project is not going to be styled or refactored at the moment, as the whole point of this project is learning.

It is not as efficient to style the app in EJS, and it's besides the point - learning to work with pg is.

You would also notice express-validator not used, that is also by choice. At the moment I wanted to take focus and time away from things I am comfortable with using - and pour my energy into learning new things and ideas.

The mini-LMS is just the begining, as I eventually want to make a fully fledged LMS app.

It is fun to work on this project, but being limited in some ways (like not having Vite bundler, frontend tools, or even component driven design system) makes it take longer than it normally would.

Ideally, my path going forward is as such:
1 - Auth (to prevent destructive actions of random users)
2 - ORM: to simplify quering (it's also a pre-requisite knowledge for moving to AdonisJS, a Laravel alternative in JS)
3 - External API and working with both client and server. /client fetches the data from the /server, and parses that data from json into a readable format.
4 - Blog editing tool, we also need it for one of my friend's websites
5 - Custom CMS built with React - or Payload CMS to speed up development speed. Kind of related to 4, but is rather a tool that can be re-used.
6 - AdonisJS, (familiarity with) Tailwind, and Typescript to get closer to C#

## What makes me happy

I am so glad I dealt with building from, and working with production database from the start. 0 re-configuration hell, took 2 mins to launch the service on render.

10/10, would reccomend
